# Dataset Download Links

This file contains links to download the datasets required for training the medical classification models.

## Brain Tumor Detection Dataset
Dataset: Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection
Source: Kaggle
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection

Description: MRI brain scans for binary classification (tumor vs no tumor)

Format: JPEG/PNG images

Installation Instructions:
1. Download the dataset from the link above
2. Extract to: brain_tumor_dataset/
3. Expected structure:
   brain_tumor_dataset/
   ├── yes/  (images with tumors)
   └── no/   (images without tumors)
